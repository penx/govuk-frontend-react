# govuk-frontend-react

[govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) as React components.


This is proof of concept, showing how <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend">govuk-frontend</a> can be used as <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS modules</a> via a <a href="https://github.com/penx/govuk-frontend-react">set of React components</a> that is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/govuk-frontend-react">published to npm</a>, in a way that is compatible with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>, with support for <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/">tree shaking</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html">code splitting/lazy loading</a>.

## Conventions

Common conventions on where our React prop names differ from the nunjucks macro option names.

| nunjucks | react |
| --- | --- |
| element | as  |
| attributes | rest props (where appropriate) |
| text | children (where appropriate) |

## Create React App support

Works! Including:
